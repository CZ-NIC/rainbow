Rainbow is part of Project Turris. This application is very closely connected
with Turris router hardware and the most of this source code will be useless on
any other HW.

This source code consists of 2 main parts:

	1) Command line utility that enables to user to set status, color and
	intensity of all LEDs of Turris router. For more informations run command
	'rainbow --help'.

	2) Daemon with basic feature: Turris has wireless card in mini PCI slot and
	so it is impossible to show wireless radio status by HW activities. Rainbow
	demon is checking wireless status and performs SW emulation of the expected
	behavior by setting WiFi LED status.
